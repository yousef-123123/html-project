  <h2>Artificial intelligence for humans</h2>
  I
n recent years there has been an enormous increase in reflection on the
impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on society and politics. It is now
often computer scientists who admonish the rest of us that impact assessments are far ahead of what current engineering can deliver. But what engineering can deliver now may offer little indication of how long it will take for
technological innovation to revolutionize this or that sector of society, and
thus ultimately society as a whole. The overall pace of innovation has picked
up over the past few decades, and today innovations spread with breathtaking
speed. Consequently, there are many questions that should be on our radar
now even though they do not currently arise with any acuteness—and it will
be too late to start thinking about them only once they do. The human rights
domain is no exception here.
This essay begins with a brief introduction to AI. We then offer examples of the
way AI has already had an effect on human rights monitoring practices. Next we
turn to an exploration of artificial general intelligence (AGI), also called superintelligence. With that groundwork laid, we discuss what humans might owe superintelligent machines. Indeed, machines may come up for moral status even before
there is an actual superintelligence. We then address the reverse question of what
such machines would owe humans and how we would manage the potential collapse of the binary distinction between machine and human. Finally, we explain
why we cannot offer real conclusions
